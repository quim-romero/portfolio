## 🧭 About this Project

This is more than a personal website — it's a **real product showcase**.  
A full-stack frontend experience that reflects **how I actually work**.

It includes:
- Custom-built projects that simulate real-world use cases.
- A live terminal interface (`NebulaOS`) for interactive exploration.
- Seamless page transitions, theme switching, internationalization, and more.
- Zero templates, zero page builders — just thoughtful code and purposeful design.
