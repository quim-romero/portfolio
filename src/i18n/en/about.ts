  intro: [
    'I’m a frontend developer with a product-first mindset. My journey started through experimentation, and later I formalized it with a degree in web development.',
    'My strengths lie in blending clean design, logical structure, and smooth animation. I use tools and automation to move fast, but my attention to detail is always manual.',
    'I’ve built full interface simulations — from dashboards to microsites — all crafted with performance and personality in mind.',

  howIWork: [
    'Quick and focused cycles — I deliver a working version early and polish fast.',
    'Detail-obsessed: from spacing to keyboard UX to microinteractions.',
    'Clear communication: I give updates, ask early, and avoid overpromising.',
    'I work solo or with teams — always bringing structure and product-thinking.',
    'User experience is a priority — the interface should feel as good as it looks.',
