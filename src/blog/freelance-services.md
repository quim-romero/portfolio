Not everyone who visits this site comes from a freelance platform — and not everyone wants to read through every article to figure out if I’m available.

So here’s the short version:  
**Yes, I’m open to freelance projects.**  
And if you're looking for fast, clean, product-oriented frontend — I might be a great fit.

## What I Offer

I specialize in **building modern, interactive web interfaces** — quickly, cleanly, and with intention. I don’t just code things that “look nice”. I build things that feel solid and make sense.

Here are some of the most common things I build:

- ✨ **Landing pages** with animations, responsive design and smooth UX
- 📊 **Dashboards** with typed logic, dynamic filtering and persistent state
- 🛰 **Microsites** for product demos or unique campaigns
- 🧩 **UI components** for startups who need frontend thinking and structure
- 📦 **Frontend architecture** that’s scalable and easy to hand off

I work with React, TypeScript, Tailwind, Framer Motion, Zustand, GSAP — and I care about **performance, accessibility, and clean structure**.

## How I Usually Work

Every project is different, but the process tends to follow this pattern:

1. **Quick alignment**  
   We clarify the scope, goals, and what matters most (speed? visuals? UX?).

2. **Early version fast**  
   I like to deliver something functional early on — even if it’s not fully styled yet. That way, we’re aligned on the direction.

3. **Focused iteration**  
   Then I layer in polish: animations, states, accessibility, edge cases.

4. **Delivery**  
   I deliver clean, well-organized code, plus docs or support if needed.

5. **Clear comms**  
   You’ll get async updates, direct feedback, and no hand-holding required.

## Ideal Clients

I usually work best with:

- Product teams who need fast frontend help
- Designers who want a dev who cares about layout and detail
- Startups who need real prototypes that _feel_ like a product

I’m comfortable working independently or as part of a team — but I always bring structure, speed and clean execution.
