One of the first questions clients ask (or think) is:

> _“What’s it like to work with you?”_

This article is my honest answer. Whether you're a recruiter, a startup founder, or someone looking to build a solid frontend — here's how I usually approach projects, from the first message to the final handoff.

---

## 1. Understand the core problem

Before touching Figma or writing code, I want to know:

- What’s the goal?
- Who is this for?
- What matters most: speed, visuals, UX, performance?
- What should this product _feel_ like?

I’m not a fan of vague briefs. If something isn’t clear, I ask questions right away. The earlier we align, the better the end result.

---

## 2. Low-fidelity exploration

Once the goal is defined, I sketch out structure and flow:

- Wireframes or visual outlines (depends on the scope)
- Notes on interaction, state, and component logic
- Feedback loop — fast and async

This part is quick but essential. It helps avoid surprises later and gets us both thinking on the same page.

---

## 3. Build fast, polish later

I code in focused sprints. I prefer to **build something that works early**, then iterate:

- I start with core layout and structure.
- Then I wire up state and logic (Zustand, React Hook Form, TypeScript).
- Then I layer on styling and motion (Tailwind, Framer Motion, GSAP if needed).

You’ll usually see a functional prototype in the first few days — not pixel-perfect, but _real_.

---

## 4. Iterate, refine, and obsess a little

Once the base is solid, I go into “obsession mode”:

- Microinteractions
- Keyboard behavior
- Animations that feel _just right_
- Performance tweaks
- UX details no one notices (but they _feel_ them)

I like this phase — it’s where the project becomes more than just “done”.

---

## 5. Delivery and handoff

At the end, I deliver:

- Clean, commented, structured code
- Optional documentation (if it’s a handoff)
- Help with deploy, if needed
- Follow-up support (case by case)

Everything is versioned, portable, and easy to maintain or expand.

---

## Bonus: How I communicate

- Async first — I’m quick with messages and updates.
- Clear estimates — I give realistic timelines, not optimistic guesses.
- Direct feedback — I care about the result, not ego.
- Calm energy — I don’t panic. I just deliver.

---

## Final thoughts

This is how I work on **every project in my portfolio** — including this website. I don’t use templates, page builders, or shortcuts. Just real thinking, real frontend, and full attention.

If that’s the kind of collaboration you’re looking for, feel free to reach out.
